Welcome to my website! My name is Marouane Tayab and I am currently a student at the Bonn University of Applied Science studying Computer Science with a specialization in Complex Software Systems. My interests are in web development and parallel programming.

During my time at [HBRS](https://www.h-brs.de/en) I got a chance to work on a couple of team projects. For more details on my studies and my project work, please check out my CV.
